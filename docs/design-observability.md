# Observability

## Health

Various health checks are exposed via HTTP health endpoints:

| endpoint    | output   | executed by | purpose                |
|-------------|----------|-------------|------------------------|
| `/healthz`  | detailed | human       | manual troubleshooting |
| `/startupz` | minimal  | Kubernetes  | startup probe          |
| `/livez`    | minimal  | Kubernetes  | liveness probe         |
| `/readyz`   | minimal  | Kubernetes  | readiness probe        |

Note: in Development mode all endpoints use detailed output

* `/healthz`
  - All health checks
* `/startupz`
  - Initialization of databases
  - Starting consumers
* `/livez`
  - Checking if consumers are working
* `/readyz`
  - Healthy connection to
    - Databases
    - Message brokers
    - Downstream services

## Distributed tracing

OpenTelemetry is utilized to make flow of communication and data exchange observable and help resolve production issues.

### Resources

Each service is represented as a separate resource with namespace, name and version.

### Instrumentation

The following instrumentation is used:
* Out-of-the-box
  - ASP.NET Core with support for gRPC server-side
  - gRPC client instrumentation for service-to-service communication
  - Npgsql client instrumentation for YugabyteDB implementing the UserDB used in User service
  - Redis client instrumentation for User cache in User service
* Custom
  - Backplane instrumentation
    - At the level of Kafka producers and consumers
  - ChatsDB instrumentation for Cassandra queries
    - At the level of Cassandra but requiring code in the application
  - Messaging instrumentation
    - at the level of SignalR

### Sampling

* During development all traces are sampled
* For Docker and Minikube deployments only a custom percentage of traces are sampled - value is set in the configuration
* The `/metrics` and health endpoints are excluded

### Exporting

* Observable services use Open Telemetry and the agnostic OTLP exporter to send collected traces
* The Open Telemetry OTel collector collects the traces and uses OTLP to push them to Jaeger
* Jaeger stores and provides access to collected traces
  - Currently the Docker image used stores traces in memory
  - For production a full deployment of Jaeger and all its components needs to be implemented

## Log aggregation

* OpenTelemetry, ElasticSearch and Kibana are utilized in the process.
* Applications services send their logs in batches to an OpenTelemetry collectors via OTLP
* The collectors are sending them again in batches to an ElasticSearch backend in a dedicated index
* Kibana is configured to access the ElasticSearch backend and provides ability to view and search logs

## Metrics

* OpenTelemetry is used to provide an HTTP `/metrics` endpoint to application services and to collect the metrics
* This endpoint is used by Prometheus to scrape the exposed metrics and store them
* Grafana visualizes data from Prometheus in custom dashboards and panels

The following metrics are exported from the servers:
* Protocol level
  - HTTP request duration histogram
  - Cassandra query duration histogram
* Application level
  - Messages
    - Received count
    - Processed count
  - Online clients count
